This plugin installs Gopass. The password manager for the command line. This
plugin simply installs the binary. It does not setup shell auto completion nor
installs missing OS dependencies.

The two external programs Gopass needs are:

    gpg - GnuPG, preferably in Version 2 or later
    git - Git SCM, any Version should be OK

It is also recommended to have either rng-tools or haveged installed.
